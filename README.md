JSON is an inherently hierarchical structure, which makes searching it for path information difficult. The `jqg` script flattens the hierarchical structure so that the path for each JSON end node is represented as a single string, thereby enabling easy searching and meaningful results.

For searching, `jqg` uses the [PCRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions) engine built into `jq`, which is much more powerful than `grep` or `egrep` (and it's certainly easier to use). For added flexibility, `jqg` can read from STDIN instead of from a file, allowing it to be used in pipelines, too. Finally, there are many options to control what is searched and how, as well as the format of the output.

```none
$ jq . odd-values.json
{
  "one": {
    "start-string": "foo",
    "null-value": null,
    "integer-number": 101
  },
  "two": {
    "two-a": {
      "non-integer-number": 101.75,
      "number-zero": 0
    },
    "true-boolean": true,
    "two-b": {
      "false-boolean": false
    }
  },
  "three": {
    "empty-string": "",
    "empty-object": {},
    "empty-array": []
  },
  "end-string": "bar"
}



# some not-too-useful grep results
$ jq . odd-values.json | grep string
    "start-string": "foo",
    "empty-string": "",
  "end-string": "bar"

$ jq . odd-values.json | grep 0
    "integer-number": 101
      "non-integer-number": 101.75,
      "number-zero": 0

$ jq . odd-values.json | grep 'int\|false'
    "integer-number": 101
      "non-integer-number": 101.75,
      "false-boolean": false



# much more useful jqg results
$ jqg string odd-values.json
{
  "one.start-string": "foo",
  "three.empty-string": "",
  "end-string": "bar"
}

$ jqg 0 odd-values.json
{
  "one.integer-number": 101,
  "two.two-a.non-integer-number": 101.75,
  "two.two-a.number-zero": 0
}

$ jqg 'int|false' odd-values.json
{
  "one.integer-number": 101,
  "two.two-a.non-integer-number": 101.75,
  "two.two-b.false-boolean": false
}



# The power of PCRE
# - find a 0 without a preceeding number
$ jqg '(?<!\\d)0' odd-values.json
{
  "two.two-a.number-zero": 0
}

# - the same or empty brackets
$ jqg '(?<!\d)0|\[\]' odd-values.json
{
  "two.two-a.number-zero": 0,
  "three.empty-array": []
}


# can be used in pipelines, too
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorthboundTrain/jqg/main/test/odd-values.json | jqg '(?<!\d)0|\[\]'
{
  "two.two-a.number-zero": 0,
  "three.empty-array": []
}
```

Many more examples are provided in [jqg-examples.md](doc/jqg-examples.md).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The `jqg` script is self-contained except for the need to have both `jq` and `bash` on the system somewhere; `bash` itself needs to be on your `$PATH`, but `jq` does not -- see the [documentation](doc/jqd.md) for more details.

### Download the Script

It's easy to get the latest stable version of the script. First decide where you want to put it, and then grab it using `wget`:

```none
cd /path/to/script/dir
wget https://github.com/NorthboundTrain/jqg/releases/latest/download/src/jqg
chmod +x jqg
```

### Clone the Repo

Alternately, you can clone the whole repo:

```none
# HTTP
cd /path/to/git/parent/dir
git clone https://github.com/NorthboundTrain/jqg.git

# SSH
cd /path/to/git/parent/dir
git clone git@github.com/NorthboundTrain/jqg.git
```

If you want to run the unit tests, you will also need the [`BATS`](https://github.com/bats-core) sub-modules; you can clone them at the same time by adding in the `--recurse-submodules` option for `git clone`:

```none
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com:NorthboundTrain/jqg.git
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:NorthboundTrain/jqg.git
```

## Usage

### Requirements

- Bash 3.0.27+
- JQ 1.6+

### Basic Usage

Execute `jqg` against a specific JSON file:

`jqg search-string foo.json`

Execute `jqg` in a pipeline:

`curl -s 'https://api.github.com/repos/NorthboundTrain/jqg' | jqg 'name|count'`

## Acknowledgements

The filters to convert the hierarchical structure of JSON into a flat structure are largely based on a blog post from [Fabian Keller](https://www.fabian-keller.de/about/) entitled [5 Useful jq Commands to Parse JSON on the CLI](https://www.fabian-keller.de/blog/5-useful-jq-commands-parse-json-cli/).

This project uses code from the following projects:

- [pure-getopt](https://github.com/agriffis/pure-getopt) - a drop-in replacement for GNU `getopt`, written in Bash
